    "# Getting Details that Describe Each Album\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify does a fantastic job of describing each track, because it has features such as the acousticness, danceability, energy, and instrumentalness as a part of its API. All of these features can be aggregated for all tracks in the album to get overall values for each feature for the whole album. These values can then be used to create a feature vector for each album."
