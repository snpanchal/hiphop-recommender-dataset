# hiphop-recommender-dataset-generation
This repo contains the Jupyter notebooks to collect the data and generate the dataset for my hip-hop album recommender application.

To get the list of rappers to focus on, I used lists from https://www.ranker.com/ for the top rappers of all time, 2019, and 2020 and the top rap groups of all time:
